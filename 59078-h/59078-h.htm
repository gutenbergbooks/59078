<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>It has green hills and parks where flowers bloom;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And shadowed pathways where young lips are shy</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And warm hands tangle while the night slips by;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Deserts of humble brick, resigned and drear;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And crowded taverns, full of noise and beer;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Thronged streets where jostle theatre and hotel,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And stately terraces where rich folk dwell....</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>It has black alleys, and most dismal plains</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Crossed by long, steady, fire-emitting trains;</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>Adventurously, in this unending town,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And magic things have seen at Fortune Green</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And fairies loitering in a grove at Sheen;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Chelsea made crimson in the sunset’s glare;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The dawn transfiguring even Russell Square....</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>And I have watched, all through a summer’s day,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The brown-winged barges loaded up with hay,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And seen the heavy cargo-steamers slide</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Past Woolwich Ferry, with the flowing tide;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Found joy in travel on a motor ’bus,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And glowing worlds Within the Radius!</i></div>

<div class="verse"><i>The cries and whispers of the London street.</i></div>

is careless ... yet one feels that a book like his ‘Country Boy’

sublime, better than this:</p>

<p>For he knows, as all true modern poets know, that the world has become
a fairy world again, and that the name of Camden Town can haunt us
as much as Xanadu, nay more. We cannot place him with Mr. Yeats,
Mr. Housman or Mr. Masefield: but he should be loved by thousands,
and the student of the future will treasure his work as a document of
fine English sentiment and feeling long after our Francis Thompson,
our Watson and our Trench are forgotten.”</p>

<p><i>Birmingham Daily Post</i>: “If Mr. Douglas Goldring does not belie
the promise of his first book, a good deal will be heard of him, and the
attractively produced little volume before us will become precious to the
collector. What matters above all else in a young poet is personality—individuality
of feeling and outlook. Possessing this, his style may
safely be left to develop itself; and this quality is unmistakably present
on every page of ‘A Country Boy, and Other Poems.’ ... Already
his individuality of vision is beginning to make its own music.”</p>

<p><i>Edward Thomas</i>: (In the London <i>Bookman</i>): “His book ‘Streets’
consists of experiments in capturing the soul, or one of the souls, of
twenty or thirty London streets. In some he speaks of his own feeling
towards them; in others he speaks for them as if he were an inhabitant.
His methods vary almost as much as his streets, from the downright to
the romantic, but he is invariably interesting, often brilliant.”</p>

<p><i>Sunday Times</i>: “Mr. Douglas Goldring has caught the glamour of
London’s highways and by-ways ... there is real poetry in this
slender volume, and Mr. Goldring has the art of suffusing with ecstasy
apparently commonplace things....”</p>

<p><i>Evening Standard</i>: “Poems of London streets remarkable for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
freshness. They are short and impressionistic, at times suggesting
comparison with the work of Mr. Davies and Mr. James Stephens....
But the poet has his own thoughts, and his own methods of expression
admirably suited to them. This little volume deserves recognition.”</p>

<p><i>Morning Post</i>: “Mr. Goldring’s book has been a great comfort to us.
All lovers of London will love it.”</p>

<p><i>Rebecca West</i> (<i>Star</i>): “I insist on saying that his volume ‘Streets’
contains some of the loveliest verse that has ever been written about
London.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
